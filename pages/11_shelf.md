# Shelf

## Description

The Shelf number or name corresponds with a location within a Bay. The Shelf numbers count bottom to top, so Shelf 1 is the first shelf above the Floor, Shelf 2 is the second shelf above the Floor, etc.

## Usage

Each entry in the Inventory List is **highly recommended** to include a Shelf number. This corresponds with a location in the Warehouse. 

Clicking the “SHELF” label sorts the entries by Shelf. More Shelves can be added for each Bay in the [Settings](93_bays_form.md).
