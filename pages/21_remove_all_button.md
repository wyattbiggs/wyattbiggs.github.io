## Description

The “Remove All” Button moves all quantities of each selected Item in the [Job Inventory List](23_job_inventory_list.md) to the [Warehouse Inventory List](06_warehouse_inventory_list.md).

## Usage

**One or more entry** must be selected in the Job Inventory List. If no entries are selected in the Job Inventory List, nothing will happen.

**No entries** need to be selected in the Warehouse Inventory List.

A **Date and Job Number** must be present to remove the entry from the Job Inventory List. If the [Date](24_date.md) is not present, an error window will appear. If the [Job Number](25_job_number.md) is not present, an error window will appear. If neither are present, both error windows will appear. After reading the error message(s), click “OK” and enter the missing job information in the [Job Form](22_job_form.md).
