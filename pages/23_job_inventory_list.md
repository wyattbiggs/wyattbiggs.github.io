# Job Inventory List

![Alt text](/images/image23.png "Job Inventory List")

## Description

The Job Inventory is where all the entries in a Job can be found. To load a previously Job, enter its [Date](24_date.md) and [Job Number](25_job_number.md). If no entries appear, all items have already been returned.

## Usage

Selecting a single entry can be done just by clicking the entry. The up arrow can select the previous entry and the down arrow can select the next entry. Once an entry is selected, holding down *shift* and clicking any entry will select that entry, the previously selected entry, and all entries between the two. Holding down *shift* and using the arrow keys has the same affect. Holding down *control* and clicking multiple entries will select just those entries, and not the ones in between.
