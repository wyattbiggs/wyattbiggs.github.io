# Date

![Alt text](/images/image24.png "Date")

## Usage

Each Job **must** include a Date.
The Date field defaults to the current date.
The Date may be entered in any of the date formats supported by Excel, but it will be converted into the form YYYY-MM-DD.
If the Date is missing or entered improperly, an error message will appear when trying to complete an action that requires it.
