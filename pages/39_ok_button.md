# "Ok" Button

![Alt text](/images/image39.png "Ok Button")

## Description

The “Ok” Button adds the new entry to the [Warehouse Inventory List](06_warehouse_inventory_list.md). It also closes the [New Window](30_new_window.md)

## Usage

If the [Item name](07_item.md) is not present, an error window will appear when this button is clicked, as every entry **must** have an Item name. After reading the error message, click “OK” and enter the missing entry information before clicking the “Ok” Button again.
