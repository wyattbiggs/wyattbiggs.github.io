![Alt text](/images/image51.png "Subtype Field")

## Description

The “Subtype” Field is a dropdown menu from which the new entry’s [Subtype](14_subtype.md) is selected from. If this field is not present, the [Type](13_type.md) in the “Type” Field does not have any Subtypes.

## Usage

To change the Subtype for the current entry, click on the down arrow on the right side of the dropdown box then click on the desired Subtype. This will close the dropdown menu.

Each Type has a different list of Subtypes. To review the list of Subtypes for each Type, go to [Settings](65_settings_window.md), then to the [“Other” Tab](74_other_tab.md), then [Subtypes](87_subtypes_form.md).
