# "Previous" Button

![Alt text](/images/image52.png "Previous Button")

## Description

The “Previous” Button selects the previous entry in the [Edit List](43_edit_list.md) and populates all fields with that entry’s information.

## Usage

The selection cycles through the Edit List, such that if the current entry is the first entry in the Edit List, the last entry will be selected.

If an Item name is not present in the current entry, an error window will appear when this button is clicked, as every entry **must** have an Item name. After reading the error message, click “Ok” and enter the missing entry information before clicking the “Previous” Button again.
