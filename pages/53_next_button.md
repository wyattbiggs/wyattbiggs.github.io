# "Next" Button

![Alt text](/images/image53.png "Next Button")

## Description

The “Next” Button selects the next entry in the [Edit List](43_edit_list.md) and populates all fields with that entry’s information.

## Usage

The selection cycles through the Edit List, such that if the current entry is the last entry in the Edit List, the first entry will be selected.

If an Item name is not present in the current entry, an error window will appear when this button is clicked, as every entry **must** have an Item name. After reading the error message, click “Ok” and enter the missing entry information before clicking the “Next” Button again.
