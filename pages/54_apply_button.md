# "Apply" Button

![Alt text](/images/image54.png "Apply Button")

## Description

The “Apply” Button saves all edits to every entry to the [Warehouse Inventory List](06_warehouse_inventory_list.md). It also closes the [Edit Window](42_edit_window.md)

## Usage

If an [Item name](07_item.md) is not present in the current entry, an error window will appear when this button is clicked, as every entry **must** have an Item name. After reading the error message, click “OK” and enter the missing entry information before clicking the “Apply” Button again.
