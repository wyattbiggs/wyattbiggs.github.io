## Description

The Queued Entries are the entries queued for permanent deletion and are found in the lower box of the [Delete Window](57_delete_window.md).

## Usage

To permanently delete all Queued Entries and the [Current Entry](58_current_entry.md) from the [Warehouse Inventory List](06_warehouse_inventory_list.md), click the [“Yes to All” Button](61_yes_to_all_button.md). This will close the Delete Window.

After the Current Entry is either permanently deleted or saved using the [“Yes” Button](60_yes_button.md) or the [“No” Button](62_no_button.md), respectively, the entry at the top of the Queued Entries list will become the Current Entry.
