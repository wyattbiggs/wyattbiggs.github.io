![Alt text](/images/image60.png "Yes Button")

## Description

The “Yes” Button **permanently deletes** the [Current Entry](58_current_entry.md) from the [Warehouse Inventory List](06_warehouse_inventory_list.md). The entry at the top of the [Queued Entries](59_queued_entries.md) list then becomes the new Current Entry. If there are no Queued Entries remaining, the [Delete Window](57_delete_window.md) will close.
