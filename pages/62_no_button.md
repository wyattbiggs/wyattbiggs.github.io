![Alt text](/images/image62.png "No Button")

## Description

The “No” Button keeps the [Current Entry](58_current_entry.md) in the [Warehouse Inventory List](06_warehouse_inventory_list.md). The entry at the top of the Queued Entries list then becomes the new Current Entry. If there are no Queued Entries remaining, the [Delete Window](57_delete_window.md) will close.
