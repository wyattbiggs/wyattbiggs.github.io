# "Abbr" Field

![Alt text](/images/image78.png "Abbr Field")

## Description

The "Abbr” Field is a text box where the abbreviated name of a given [Unit of Measure](08_unit_of_measure.md) is displayed. This text is able to be altered.

## Usage

If the UoM already exists, the ["UoM" Field](77_uom_field.md) will automatically be filled with its corresponding abbreviation.

Each Unit of Measure **must** include both a full name and an abbreviation. If the "UoM" Field or the "Abbr" Field is empty, an error window will appear when clicking the ["Add” Button](79_add_button.md).
